## Success Criteria

All of these should be TRUE:

- [ ] Container rebuilt successfully
- [ ] No error logs in `docker logs chatbot_api`
- [ ] Health endpoint returns `{"status":"ok"}`
- [ ] Test 1 returns 1-2 sentences (not 3-4)
- [ ] Test 2 includes phone + link + price
- [ ] Test 3 follows specific script
- [ ] Test 4 is casual and brief
- [ ] Test 5 stays concise even with KB context
- [ ] Bot sounds conversational (not corporate)
- [ ] All "CRITICAL" instructions in system prompt are followed

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Container won't start
```bash
# Check logs for errors
docker logs chatbot_api

# Check if port is in use
netstat -tuln | grep 8000

# Restart if needed
docker compose down
docker compose up --build -d
```

### Issue: Old behavior persists
```bash
# Force rebuild without cache
docker compose down
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up -d

# Clear any cached models (if needed)
docker exec -it chatbot_api rm -rf /root/.cache/huggingface/*
docker compose restart
```

### Issue: Database connection error
```bash
# Check if postgres is running
docker ps | grep postgres

# Restart postgres
docker compose restart postgres

# Wait 10 seconds, then restart api
sleep 10
docker compose restart api
```

---

## Rollback Procedure (if needed)

If something goes wrong:

```bash
# On your local machine
git log --oneline -5
git revert <commit-hash-of-changes>
git push origin main

# On server
cd ChatBot
git pull origin main
docker compose up --build -d
```

---

## Notes

- **Only backend changed** - No frontend rebuild needed
- **Database unchanged** - No migration needed
- **Zero downtime** - Docker handles container swap
- **Persistent data** - All DB data and uploads preserved

---

## Verification Commands Summary

Quick copy-paste verification:

```bash
# On server
docker ps
docker logs chatbot_api --tail 20
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

---

**Deployment Date:** October 2, 2025  
**Estimated Downtime:** ~30 seconds (during container swap)  
**Risk Level:** Low (only logic changes, no schema changes)  
**Rollback Time:** ~2 minutes if needed
