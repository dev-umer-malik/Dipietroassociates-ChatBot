# System Prompt Priority Changes

## üéØ Objective
Make the system prompt ABSOLUTE PRIORITY - ensuring all custom instructions (especially the DiPietro 1-2 sentence rule) are strictly followed by the AI.

## ‚úÖ Changes Made

### 1. **Removed System Prompt Manipulation** (`rag_service.py`)
- **BEFORE**: The system was modifying/overriding the user's system prompt with generic instructions
- **AFTER**: System prompt is now used EXACTLY as provided - no modifications

### 2. **Simplified RAG Context Integration**
- **BEFORE**: Complex logic tried to "create flexible prompts" that diluted user instructions
- **AFTER**: KB context is clearly labeled as SUPPLEMENTARY information that enhances but doesn't override

### 3. **Removed Conflicting Helper Methods**
- Deleted: `_get_length_instruction()` - was overriding system prompt length rules
- Deleted: `_get_conversational_instruction()` - was overriding system prompt style
- Deleted: `_get_max_tokens()` - was restricting responses artificially
- Deleted: `_create_flexible_system_prompt()` - was rewriting the entire system prompt

### 4. **Optimized AI Parameters**
- **Temperature**: Changed from 0.7 to 0.3 for more consistent adherence to instructions
- **Max Tokens**: Changed from dynamic (50-1000) to fixed 800, letting system prompt control length
- **Model**: Respects messaging_config but doesn't override system prompt rules

## üîß Technical Details

### How RAG Now Works:

1. **No KB Results** ‚Üí Pure system prompt (unmodified)
   ```python
   messages = [{"role": "system", "content": system_prompt}]
   ```

2. **With KB Results** ‚Üí System prompt + clearly separated KB data
   ```python
   rag_system_prompt = (
       f"{system_prompt}\n\n"
       f"===== RELEVANT KNOWLEDGE BASE INFORMATION =====\n"
       f"{context}\n"
       f"===== END OF KNOWLEDGE BASE INFORMATION =====\n\n"
       f"CRITICAL REMINDER: Follow ALL instructions from your core identity above."
   )
   ```

## üìã Expected Behavior After Deploy

### With Your DiPietro System Prompt:
‚úÖ **WILL FOLLOW**: "Maximum 1-2 sentences for ALL responses"  
‚úÖ **WILL FOLLOW**: "Sound like a real human receptionist - conversational and casual"  
‚úÖ **WILL FOLLOW**: "NO corporate speak"  
‚úÖ **WILL FOLLOW**: "Always provide relevant links AND phone number"  
‚úÖ **WILL FOLLOW**: All specific response scenarios and scripts  

### What Changed:
‚ùå **NO MORE**: Generic "be conversational" overrides  
‚ùå **NO MORE**: "Write 2-3 sentences" when you specified 1-2  
‚ùå **NO MORE**: Token limits forcing truncation  
‚ùå **NO MORE**: RAG instructions diluting your specific rules  

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

1. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Prioritize system prompt - remove generic overrides"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **SSH to Server:**
   ```bash
   ssh root@172.93.53.168
   # Password: H2LCCqaFJa
   ```

3. **Navigate & Pull:**
   ```bash
   cd ChatBot
   git pull origin main
   ```

4. **Rebuild Backend** (only backend changed):
   ```bash
   docker compose up --build -d
   ```

5. **Verify:**
   - Check container logs: `docker logs chatbot_api`
   - Test a few queries to ensure 1-2 sentence responses
   - Verify conversational tone is maintained

## üß™ Testing Checklist

After deployment, test these scenarios:

- [ ] "What do you do?" ‚Üí Should be 1-2 sentences max
- [ ] "How much is CPR training?" ‚Üí Should include price range + phone + link
- [ ] "Do you train individuals?" ‚Üí Should redirect in 1-2 sentences
- [ ] Casual greeting ‚Üí Should respond casually, not corporate
- [ ] Complex question ‚Üí Should stay concise even with KB context

## üìù Notes

- **No frontend changes needed** - this is backend only
- **Database unchanged** - no schema modifications
- **Widget unaffected** - purely server-side logic changes
- **Backward compatible** - works with all existing data

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Rollback Plan (if needed)

If issues occur, revert commit:
```bash
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
# Then rebuild: docker compose up --build -d
```
