# üìã SUMMARY: System Prompt Priority Fix

**Date:** October 2, 2025  
**Type:** Backend Logic Fix  
**Impact:** High (Behavior Change)  
**Risk:** Low (No Schema Changes)  

---

## üéØ Problem

Your detailed system prompt with specific instructions (like "Maximum 1-2 sentences for ALL responses") was being overridden by generic RAG service logic. The bot would:
- Respond with 3-4 sentences instead of 1-2
- Use corporate language instead of conversational tone
- Ignore your specific scripts and scenarios
- Apply generic "helpful AI" behavior instead of following your receptionist personality

---

## ‚úÖ Solution

Modified `app/services/rag_service.py` to make system prompt **ABSOLUTE PRIORITY**:

### Changes Made:
1. **Removed all system prompt manipulation** - Now uses your prompt exactly as written
2. **Deleted override helper methods** - No more generic instructions diluting your rules
3. **Simplified RAG context integration** - KB info is clearly marked as supplementary only
4. **Optimized AI parameters** - Lower temperature (0.3) for consistency, generous token limit (800) to let your prompt control length

### Code Impact:
- **Lines Changed:** ~100 lines simplified
- **Files Modified:** 1 file (`app/services/rag_service.py`)
- **Methods Removed:** 4 helper methods that were causing overrides
- **Net Effect:** Simpler, more predictable behavior

## üìä Expected Behavior Changes

### Before ‚Üí After

| Scenario | Before | After |
|----------|--------|-------|
| **Length** | 3-4 sentences | 1-2 sentences (as specified) |
| **Tone** | Corporate/Generic | Conversational/Human |
| **Scripts** | Ignored | Followed precisely |

## üöÄ Deployment

**What You Need to Do:**

1. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix: Prioritize system prompt"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy to Server:**
   ```bash
   ssh root@172.93.53.168
   cd ChatBot
   git pull origin main
   docker compose up --build -d
   ```

3. **Test (Critical!):**
   - Ask: "What do you do?"
   - Verify: Gets 1-2 sentences (not 3-4)
   - Verify: Sounds conversational (not corporate)

## üìÅ Documentation Files Created

1. **SYSTEM_PROMPT_PRIORITY_CHANGES.md** - Technical details of all changes
2. **BEFORE_AFTER_COMPARISON.md** - Visual comparison with examples
3. **DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md** - Step-by-step deployment guide
4. **SUMMARY.md** - This file (executive overview)

---

## ‚ö° Quick Test After Deploy

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Quick chat test
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "What do you do?", "client_id": "test123"}'
```

**Expected:** Response should be 1-2 sentences max, conversational tone.

---

## üîÑ Rollback Plan

If issues occur:
```bash
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
# Then on server: git pull && docker compose up --build -d
```

---

## üí° Key Insight

**The Problem Wasn't the System Prompt Content** - It was excellent!  
**The Problem Was the Code** - It was modifying/overriding your instructions.

Now your system prompt is treated as the **primary law** that cannot be overridden by any other logic. KB context and other data are clearly marked as supplementary information only.

---

## üéì What This Means for You

- ‚úÖ **No more fighting with the bot** - It will follow your instructions exactly
- ‚úÖ **Consistent behavior** - Every response matches your style
- ‚úÖ **Easier to maintain** - Change system prompt = change behavior (no code tweaks needed)
- ‚úÖ **Better user experience** - Bot sounds like YOUR receptionist, not a generic AI

---

## üìû Support

If you encounter any issues after deployment:

1. Check `docker logs chatbot_api` for errors
2. Verify container is running: `docker ps`
3. Test health endpoint: `curl http://localhost:8000/health`
4. Review DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md for troubleshooting steps

---

## Next Steps

After successful deployment:

1. [ ] Test with various questions
2. [ ] Verify 1-2 sentence responses
3. [ ] Check conversational tone
4. [ ] Confirm phone numbers and links appear
5. [ ] Test with your actual users
6. [ ] Monitor for a few days
7. [ ] Adjust system prompt if needed (now it will actually work!)

---

**Bottom Line:** Your system prompt now controls everything. The bot will behave exactly as you've instructed in your detailed prompt.

**Status:** ‚úÖ Ready to deploy  
**Confidence:** High  
**Downtime:** ~30 seconds  
**Rollback Time:** ~2 minutes if needed
